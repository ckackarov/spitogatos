Frontend Engineer Assignment

In this assignment we are sending you the mockups (both desktop and mobile versions) of a single page
website. We have formulated this assignment to test your technical knowledge in presentational and
javascript front-end technologies.
Prior to starting implementation, we advise you to carefully read what to do and what not to do. Below
you will find 2 urls containing all of the necessary elements for both mobile and desktop versions.
The design has been made in AdobeXD and you can easily access the designs in your browser

Other Instructions
In the upper right corner, you can toggle between design &amp; developer view. In the design view some
elements will be clickable showing you the user’s interactions.
In the developer view you can access css data by clicking on the elements, but keep in mind that these
are only for reference. You don’t have to copy everything (for example widths and heights)
In this assignment we want to evaluate the aspect of presentational frontend technologies (HTML/CSS
markup in general) and javascript essential knowledge.
Please ignore the search icon and the off-canvas search panel. These should not be implemented.
What are our expectations?
We expect the design to be fully responsive. You’re free to think about which breakpoints you want to
support (think about the why as well).
Depending on your level of experience we of course expect different solutions. Make choices based on
what you think you can do within the given time. Please do not feel overwhelmed by the assignment,
just focus on what you know.
Visual aspect:
Things you should think about:
 Making the website fully responsive
 Delivering almost pixel perfect markup is very crucial. In AdobeXD you will easily have access in
padding/margin/font-size values.
Things you could think about:

 How does the menu open and close?
 Using the same navigation in both mobile &amp; desktop versions
 Think of the best ways to implement the svg images
Things you should NOT do
 Page scrollbar should be the browser’s default so do not try to implement the design’s blue one
 You may simply hide form input placeholders instead of implementing the effect in the designs
 The map must be just an image
 Do not implement the search icon and its off canvas search panel
Javasctipt tasks:
Things you should think about:

1. Implementing the hero banner slideshow (either by using vendor libraries or creating your own
   custom solution)
2. Contact form –validation, error and success states
   Needed Validation rules:

   name: required, only letters

   email:. required,
   valid email address, ( Nice to Have: Allow only @spitogatos.gr suffix )

   phone: required, only numbers, (Nice to Have: Pattern of three digits, three digits, then four digits,
   separated by either spaces, dashes, or dots).

   Select gory &amp; subcategory): these will be populated on load.
   The app should call the
   following url and use the http response to populate the fields. These will be cascading fields meaning
   that the subcategory options must be these of the selected category and change every time the
   category changes. Select dropdowns can be native select dropdowns. Don’t worry about the design.
